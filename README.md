# Intro to ICHI
ICHI is self-sustaining, community governed infrastructure that enables any cryptocurrency community to create and govern their own in-house, non-custodial oneToken (a stablecoin valued at $1).

ICHI 
1) Makes a stable currency (oneToken) for any existing coin/token community, 
2) Applies market forces to set level of reserves backing the stablecoin between 0-100% to provide stability that is just as good as fiat-backed stablecoins as you can redeem them for exactly 1 USDC, 
3) Locks up existing coins and is fully on-chain creating more demand for the said token, and 
4) Gives oneToken holders the ability to govern their member coin‚Äôs Treasury.

In addition, ICHI introduces an innovative DAO-like governance model for the overarching decisions made on the development of the entire platform, incentivizing adoption and encouraging real commitment to the ICHI community from its members.
